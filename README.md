# ~~Nick's~~ Les's Project Euler stuff

This is a collection of my source code solutions to Project Euler
problems, sorted into different folders for different languages.


## BIG FAT WARNING

I mostly use Project Euler for learning new programming languages since I
can't come up with my own "homework problems." This means that this
code probably really sucks and is likely not representative of my current
skill in a given language.

Also, please don't use this to cheat at Project Euler. :)
